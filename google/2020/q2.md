Go is played on a 19x19 grid of intersections. Two players take turns putting down white stones and black stones. Every stone or group of stones need to have at least one liberty to stay on the board. A liberty is an empty point vertically or horizontally next to a stone, see example below:

Once a stone or a group of stones lose all of their liberties, we can then capture those pieces. If a black stone is placed in any of the  of the intersections marked with X in the following picture, then the white stone/s are captured:

Given a board and the coordination of a black stone, please determine if the stone or group of stones are captured or not.

[[W, W, E],
 [W, B, W],
 [E,E, E] ]  length= 3 max i =1

x= 1 y = 1
for each combination:
check around it if they have the opposite
if there is empty around
return false
if any has the same color
recursive(its coordination)

```js
function isCaptured(board, x, y){
  //top
  if(x > 0){
    if(board[x-1][y] === “E”)
    return false;
    if(board[x-1][y] !== “W”)
    isCaptured(board, x-1, y);
  }

  //bottom
  if(x < board.length-1){
    if(board[x+1][y] === “E”)
    return false;
    if(board[x+1][y] !== “W”)
    isCaptured(board, x+1, y);
  }

  //right
  if(y < board[0].length-1){
    if(board[x][y+1] === “E”)
    return false;
    if(board[x][y+1] !== “W”)
    isCaptured(board, x, y+1);
  }

  //left
  if(y > 0){
    if(board[x][y-1] === “E”)
    return false;
    if(board[x][y-1] !== “W”)
    isCaptured(board, x, y+1);
  }

  return true;
}
```
